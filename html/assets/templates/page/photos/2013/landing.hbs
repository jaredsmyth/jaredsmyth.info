        <p>a note to you (excerpt from the book)

in 2013 i set out to take a series of photos each day â€“ a minimum of three photos a day.
these photos were shot, edited, and published to my blog by the end of each day.
the following photos were all shot in 2013, some published to the blog, but many more never published anywhere before.

included you will find photos from oakland, san francisco, el cerrito, berkeley, and monte rio / russian river, california. photos from portland, oregon, austin, texas, tallahassee, florida, and sanibel island, florida.
